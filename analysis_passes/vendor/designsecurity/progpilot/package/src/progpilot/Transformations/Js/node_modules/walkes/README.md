## Installation

    $ npm install walkes

Or as a `component`:

    $ component install Swatinem/walkes

## Compatibility warning

`walkes ~ 0.1.0` used to pass in the node as `this`. This changed with version
`~ 0.2.0` which passes it as the first parameter. Please keep that in mind, and
sorry for the inconvenience.

## Usage

walkes works with an [estree spec](https://github.com/estree/estree) compatible
ast. You are free to choose whichever parser you would like, such as esprima,
espree, babel, acorn or others.

```js
walker(espree.parse("â€¦"), {
	MemberExpression: function (node, recurse, stop) {
		// you are responsible to call `recurse()` on all the children yourself
		recurse(node.object);
		recurse(node.property);
		// or use `walker.checkProps` to walk all child properties (also takes care of arrays)
		walker.checkProps(node, recurse);
	},
	default: function (recurse, stop) {
		// call or throw `stop` to completely stop walking.
		stop();
		throw stop;
	}
}, offset);
// when offset is set, will only recurse to nodes that lie within the offset
// esprima option {range: true} needs to be set for this to work
```
